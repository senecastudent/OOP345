Authenticity Declaration:
I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that
my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.

In the completion of this workshop, I got to learn a lot of concepts which include:

1. Difference between internal and external linkage: 
External Linkage - A name with external linkage refers to an entity that is declared in a different scope within another translation unit. The C++ keyword extern identifies external linkage. For the workshop we used "extern double g_taxrate;" and "extern double g_dailydiscount;." 
Internal linkage - A name with internal linkage refers to an entity that is invisible outside its translation unit, but visible to other scopes within its translation unit. The C++ keyword static identifies internal linkage. For the workshop, we used "static int count = 1;" - Global throughout the program with limited scope, in the display function.

2. Static variables exist for the lifetime of the program, retaining their values between function calls.

3. For upgrading the FoodOrder class in part 2:
a. We had to convert the char array into a char pointer which will be dynamically allocated depending on the size of the food description read from the file. 
b. Since we had resources outside of class and to manage resources properly we had to implement the RULE OF 3 - copy constructor, copy assignment, destructor.

4. I also understood about how main function receives 2 arguments, int argc (the count of arguments), char* argv[] (the argument values)

5. This workshop helped me recollect the cout/ostream class methods used for formatting like (width, fill, setf, and more)

6. Global Variables and extern Keyword: Lastly, this workshop helped me understand the concept of global variables properly using the keyword extern.
